This is a semi-serious attempt at using TescoLabs APIs to create some code to demo the potential of organisation APIs
to stimulate for Retail innovation external to the Enterprise (in this case Tesco).
Other examples might include Walgreens and UK Post Office/RMG

Aside from giving me a personal opportunuty to learn Python, RESTful APIs, JSON, GitHub, PaaS, OpenShift and eventually Docker when OpenShift v3 becomes available. Just enough for a Solutions Architect to become dangerous :-)

Phases:

[1] Text based python script to perform product search against Tesco API. [Complete]

[2] Convert [1] to a Web based application running on an OpenShift Online gear / container [In Progress]

[3] Create a shim HTML5 web app on Cisco EMSP to front-end [2] and make contextual to geo-location as a demo

[4] Possibly create a native web app.

[5] Fork another repo to integrate other APIs - Meraki, Eagle Eye, Evrythng and see what happens...

Notes:

Need to register for Tesco Labs API if you want to code your own version and get a developer and application key:
